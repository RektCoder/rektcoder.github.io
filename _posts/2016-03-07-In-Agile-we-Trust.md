Back in 2010 my employer started pushing Agile methods for software development in a big way.  Scrum was the method of choice.  As part of this push toward Agile, we had an off site meeting with presentations by in-house Agile "experts".  At the time, the whole thing felt to me like religious zealotry, but I pushed that thought aside and continued to watch and listen to the presentations.  In the years after this session, I continued to have the nagging feeling that this seems more like a religion than a software development process whenever I dealt with one of the zealots who claimed that Agile would solve all my problems.  

I always thought it was just me until I came across this article: [Scrum is dead: breaking down the new open development method](https://opensource.com/business/15/11/open-development-method).  In this article the author compares the "Manifesto for Agile Software Development" to a holy text and Scrum meetings to daily devotions.  He doesn't mention religion explicitly, but I couldn't help but realise that others are also seeing the parallels between Agile and religion.  

Apart from the holy text and daily devotions, there are other similarities between Agile and religion: like speaking out against Agile is pretty much heresy.  Even though Scrum suggests a retrospective at the end of each sprint, this task is reserved for smaller self-improvement efforts within the project, but one shouldn't use it at the end of a project to rock the boat on the larger questions.  Comments like: *"The Scrum process didn't really fit well on this project and sucked.  Why didn't it work in this case and can we modify it or use another process in future for similar types of projects?"* would either be met with blank stares or being burned at the stake for heresy or witchcraft.  As with most religions you are allowed to question things, as long as you don't question the religion itself.  Also, most religions claim that they could solve all your problems and if it doesn't work, then you are somehow doing it wrong.  Since that fateful session in 2010, if only I counted the amount of times Agile zealots said: *"In most dev shops where people complained that Agile didn't work, it was because they didn't follow the Agile process to the letter."* or something along those lines.  

There is now a steady stream of articles and blog postings denouncing Agile.  Some selling "new" snake oil they hope will be next week's "software process of the moment".  After this reformation is complete, we will have a new and equally flawed religion of software development unless we stop the zealotry.  I am a strong believer in separation of church and code.  There are plenty of software development processes and approaches out there.  Why limit how you develop software by what is fasionable in this very second.  Like any software process, Agile has it pros and cons.  It will work better on certain types of projects and not work well for others.  Spend some time to think what makes sense for the specific project you are facing.  Make a decision on the software process you want to follow based on your environment and the criteria for the specific project.  

When the zealots say *"Thou shalt Scrumt"*, don't get rekt... JUST SAY NO.
